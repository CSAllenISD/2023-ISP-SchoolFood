                      | Hey! My name is Hamza Ebeida, I'm a junior at Allen High School, I enjoy, eating, sleeping, messing around with pretty much anyone, and well, Programming! I've been passionate about coding since I can remember, currently I'm on an FRC and FTC team as the Team Captain and Lead Programmer. I'm learing about things like PID, Odometry, Image Recognition and Image Processing, and tons more. Programming has given me the opportuinity to get and internship with a startup here in Dallas, and I'm thankful for every bit of that!
